NTQQ Protocol Implementation with Pure TypeScript, derived from the following projects:
- [LagrangeDev/Lagrange.Core](https://github.com/LagrangeDev/Lagrange.Core)
- [takayama-lily/oicq](https://github.com/takayama-lily/oicq)
- [LagrangeDev/lagrangejs](https://github.com/LagrangeDev/lagrangejs)

The word "tanebi" is from Japanese and means "tinder" in English or "火种" in Chinese. The name is in respect of previous and contemporary QQ protocol implementation projects. No matter they are alive or not, they are the "tanebi" of today's QQ bot development.

This is _currently_ an experimental project intended to confirm the feasibility of implementing NTQQ protocol with TypeScript, instead of a full-featured project. The following features are planned to be implemented:

- [x] Encryption & Decryption
- [x] Login by QR Code
- [x] Login by stored session
- [x] Send messages
- [x] Receive text messages
- [x] Fetch contact list & group member list
- [ ] Upload picture

> [!TIP]
> If you want to contribute to this project, please consider using **Visual Studio Code** instead of JetBrains IDEs to improve type inferring performance and enhance coding experience.
