# lagrange-ts

NTQQ Protocol Implementation with Pure TypeScript, derived from the following projects:
- [LagrangeDev/Lagrange.Core](https://github.com/LagrangeDev/Lagrange.Core)
- [takayama-lily/oicq](https://github.com/takayama-lily/oicq)
- [LagrangeDev/lagrangejs](https://github.com/LagrangeDev/lagrangejs)

This is _currently_ an experimental project intended to confirm the feasibility of implementing NTQQ protocol with TypeScript, instead of a full-featured project. The following features are planned to be implemented:

- [x] Encryption & Decryption
- [x] Login by QR Code
- [ ] Login by stored session
- [ ] Send & receive messages
- [ ] Fetch contact list & group member list
- [ ] Upload picture
